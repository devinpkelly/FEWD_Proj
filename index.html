            <p class="lead mt-5">This gallery was created as part of a project but also as a way for me to showcase some of my photography. I will discuss my three favorite types of photography and why I enjoy them. While they are all their own type there is a considerable amount of overlap between the three styles as it is possible for one photograph to fall into all three categories.</p>

                     <p class="custom">I enjoy black and white photography because it is excellent for portrait photography or when you want your photos to have a timeless feel to them. They also help bring focus to the subject because the lack of color is less distracting.</p>

                     <p class="custom">Street photography provides great photos and often show a different perspective of the world. Subjects of street photography can range from graffiti, buildings, people, or even something as simple as an object on the ground.</p>

                     <p class="custom">Motion photography is exciting because you are capturing objects in motion and displaying them as if they were frozen in time. You can adjust camera settings to convey the feeling of motion by adding a blur to the subject or the background depending on how position the camera.</p>
