## Description

This website was designed to showcase some of my photography.  I'm interested in serveral different types of photography so I wanted a site that could display them by different categories/styles

As of March 1st I completely started over.  This is my first commit after redoing index.html and Style.css
*March 24th I have all the content finished with the exception of hte Javascript portion.  I've not been successful in getting anything to successfully display images from my instagram or Flickr pages.

## Custom CSS Classes

The classes I created are:

1. .navbar
adds padding & changes background color of .main-info-section.

2. .gallery
formats the gallery I'm using to display the images on my webpage.  Padding, box shadows etc.

3. .a (visited and hover)
applies color changes to hyperlinks depending on their status (hover/visited/unclicked)

4. .body
formats the .html pages font, color, and the background gradient


## Custom JavaScript Functions

The javascript function I created is:

1. flickr.js
.. AJAX function that interacts with Flickr API on my personal account to pull images and display them in a gallery.
